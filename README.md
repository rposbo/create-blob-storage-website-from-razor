# Hello

This repo contains some basic RazorEngine functionality to retrieve Razor views from *BlobStorage* (/content), merge it with the json data in *BlobStorage* (/data), and output the resulting html into *BlobStorage* (/output).

It's just a worker role and there are a few basic tests around the main class **RenderHtmlPage**.

>Initially the cshtml and json files are not committed; these will be included in later commits.
